# Invoicer

**Invoicer** is a simple application to ingest a digital invoice (currently only compatible with Pingo Doce) displaying a simple Frontend to allow for an exact, item-by-item expense sharing.

The project is currently under development and the idea is to eventually have the expenses stored in a databse to allow for a running tally, allowing for the creation of Groups.

The next step in the development process is to allow users to upload a picture of the paper invoice instead of the digital version, and then use OCR to extract the relevant info.
